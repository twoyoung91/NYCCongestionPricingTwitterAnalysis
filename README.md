Congestion pricing has been a widely debated tool in the academic community, and its implementation often faces considerable resistance. New York City is now at the forefront of these debates as it is set to put its congestion policy program into operation in 2024. These debates have also spilled over to social media. While social media platforms such as Twitter (now known as X), are often used to measure public opinion, it is unclear how representative they may be of different socioeconomic groups. This study employs GPT-4, a large language model, to analyze tweets to learn how representative they are. Results were validated using multiple test datasets. Our study demonstrated that the GPT-4 model can assist planners in obtaining satisfactory results from social media analysis with less time and preparation compared to traditional natural language processing models. Findings show that Twitter account users located farther from downtown were more likely to view congestion pricing in a negative light. This is expected as these communities will pay more to commute when the toll goes into effect. Women, minority groups, and individuals in low-income occupations are significantly underrepresented on Twitter, necessitating that planners consider alternative methods to solicit feedback from these demographics.
